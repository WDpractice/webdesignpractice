    <h2>Visiting Europe for a few weeks</h2>
    <p>I went on a trip to Europe recently, visiting four different countries while I was there:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spain</li>
      <li>Portugal</li>
      <li>Turkey</li>
      <li>The United Kingdom</li>
    </ul>
      <p>I'd traveled to Spain and the United Kingdom (<abbr>UK</abbr>) before, but Portugal and Turkey were new for me.
        While I stayed longer in Portugal and particularly enjoyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto">Porto</a>, I enjoyed Turkey (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul">Istanbul</a> specifically) even
        more.</p>
